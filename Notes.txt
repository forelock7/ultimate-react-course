Section 3: A First Look at React
*****************************************************************************************************************

- Vanila JS - pure JS without any framework, but can be Jquery

- Vanila JS vs React: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-first-app-advice-52879f

- React - JS library for building user interfaces. 
1) Based on components - combining blocks of complex UI
2) Declarative 
 + describe how components look like and how they work using a declarative syntax called JSX.  
 + Declarative telling React what a component shoulld look like, based on current data/State
 + React is abstraction away from DOM: we never touch the DOM(like vanilla JS)
 + JSX: a syntax that combines HTML, CSS, JS as well as referencing other components.
3) State-driven: REACT reacts to state changes by re-rendering the UI. State -> Render -> UI(Component written with JSX) -> Action on UI -> Update state -> Re-render -> UI
4) JS library - React is just library (not framework), because it's only the 'view' layer. We need to pick multiple external libraries to build a comlete application. Complite frameworks built on top of React - NEXT.js, Remix
5) Extremely popular - a lot of companies use React
6) Created by facebook in 2011 by Jordan Walke

- Two option for setting up a project
1) create-react-app (complete 'starter kit', ESLint, Prettier, Jest etc) - slow and outdated technologies. It's used for small projects.
2) VITE - modern too. Need to manually set up ESLint. Extrimaly fast host replacement (HMR) and bundling. It's used for real projects

- NEXT.js and Remix framework provide more functionality than Vanila React by itself.

- Create React project using 'create-react-app'
npx create-react-app@5 pizza-menu

- To run JS/TS inside VScode use 'Quokka.js' extansios
